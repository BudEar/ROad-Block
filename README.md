# ROad-Block
Romanian Ad block (ROad Block) filtering list.

This list was started because the existing one wasn't strict enough.

If you find any issues with it, please open a ticket.

If you want to contribute filters, pull requests or open issues are welcome.


# Adding the custom filter

There are multiple ways to add this filter to your blocker, unfortunately a bit cumbersome due to a missing feature in the github markdown.

* Go to [filterlists.com](https://filterlists.com/),search for **ROad** then click on add
* Go to [my own website](http://www.kepler42.net/test.html) and click on add
or
* manually add it to your ad blocker
